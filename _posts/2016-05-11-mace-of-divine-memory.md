As I read through some published modules and plan my new fantasy campaign I substitute every bland magic item and vanilla `+#` weapon with something more colorful.

This is my reworking of a simple `+1` mace.

**Type:**

Heavy Mace

**Description:**

This heavy mace consists of a long wooden handle and the top is an oblong iron ball with five equal iron flangs. It is designed for delivering one-handed concussive damage against armored opponents. The Mace of Divine Memory is obviously of superb craftsmanship, but have no noteworthy features except a deep purple shine to the iron flangs.

**History:**

*The Mace of Divine Memory* has been used by especially devote war priests through centuries. The clerics wielding the mace were recognized as very accomplished in battle and the weapon’s power is believed to come directly from the god of war. Succesful battle clerics recieved a small amount of divine power on succesful attacks, but could just as well fall out of favor when not doling out divine rage.

**Game effects:**

Only clerics get the benefits of wielding the *Mace of Divine Memory*. To all other classes it works as a normal mace.

The cleric receives a `+1` bonus to hit and damage.

Also a cleric wielding the mace will be able to recall a spell on a critical hit (natural `20`). Likewise a fumble will make her forget a spell (natural `1`). The spells received (or taken away) in this manner must be among the spells the cleric knows and has cast during the day. It can not increase nor decrease the cleric’s spell limit. That is: a cleric that has cast no spells scores a `20` to hit and received the battle blessing of the *Mace of Divine Memory* – but since she is at her maximum spells she won’t receive an extra spell. A cleric that previously has cast *Cure Light Wounds* will find that it miraculously returns to her memory. When a cleric loses a spell she must randomly determine (i.e. let the dice decide) which spell she loses. A spell lost in this way can be regained on another critical hit with the mace. If the cleric has cast several spells before she scores a `20` she can decide which spell to regain.
