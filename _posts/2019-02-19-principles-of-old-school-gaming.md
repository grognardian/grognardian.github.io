I've been toying with the idea of writing my own little **Player's Handbook** for possible forthcoming old school games. I'm currently playing, and enjoying, a *Castles & Crusades*-campaign, with some modified rules, but real old school it definitely isn't. The simplified, combined with the improvisational and procedural, rules of old school is becoming more and more appealing to me, and I need to solidify and put to paper what I ideally would like to play.  <!--more--> In the process I will pick and choose from my betters of course. Many blogs are inspiring, and also rulesets like *Labyrinth Lord*, *The Black Hack* and even maybe the slick skill-solution from *Castles & Crusades* will possibly be a part of my house rules.

However, before I begin the process of putting the rules together I need to define some of the principles of old school gaming.

### What is the game **about**?

- The game is about **player ingenuity**, ***not\*** character abilities or power level
- The game is about **exploration** and **survival in a dangerous environment**
- The game is about **creative problem solving**
- The game is about **making choices**, and facing **consequences**
- The game is about **improvising** with what is **at hand**, and **uncovering** what is **hidden**

### How does it **work**?

- Character generation is **quick** and **easy**
- Solutions are **seldom** found on the character sheet
- The character's backstory is **happening** now
- The game takes place in a **sandbox**
- The game is **open-ended**
- The world is not **static** and it will **evolve** whether the characters get involved in current affairs or not
- The **farther out, down or up** the **harder** it will be
- The game is **lethal** and **unbalanced**.
- Be prepared. Be aware of portents. Never fight fair. Be smarter. Apply tactics. Run!
- The **real killer** is **the dice**
- The decision of the referee is final. **Rulings**, not rules.
- **Player agency** is the driving force
- **Random tables** will surprise both players and the referee through **encounters**, **treasure** and **events**
- Experience (**XP**) rewards from **spending** gold, **and** defeating, overcoming, befriending or bypassing opponents and obstacles
- **Metagaming** is **allowed**, as there is no strict line between player and character knowledge
- There will always be **several solutions** to a problem, many might be **hidden**, or even **unknown** to all
